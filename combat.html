      -Everyone, <i>at first</i>
  </h4>
  <h2>What can I do on my turn?</h2>
  <p>
  On each turn in combat, you can do each of the following <i>once</i> (in any order):
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Move</b></th>
        <td>You can move up to your speed in feet. You can move before, after, or between any actions/bonus actions you take.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Action</b></th>
        <td>Attack, cast a spell, dash, disengage, dodge, hide, ready, help, use an item</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Bonus Action</b></th>
        <td>Certain spells and class features are considered bonus actions. You can do these <i>in addition</i> to an action and movement. See below.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Item Interaction</b></th>
        <td>You get one free item interaction per turn such as drawing or sheating a weapon, opening a door, pulling a lever, dropping or picking up an item. (Note: drinking a potion requires an action, <i>not</i> an item interaction.</th>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h3>Movement</h3>
  You can move up to your speed in feet on your turn. You can intersperse your action and bonus action anywhere during movement, so
  with a speed of 30, a turn could look like:
  <ol>
    <li><i>"I move 10 feet."</i></li>
    <li><i>"I attack the goblin with my shortsword as my action."</i></li>
    <li><i>"I 5 more feet.</i></li>
    <li><i>"I cast <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Misty%20Step#content">Misty Step</a> as my bonus action (provided I know the spell).</i></li>
    <li><i>"I move my remaining 15 feet.</i></li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <p>
  Actions constitute most of the things you'd want to "do" on your turn. The main options are:
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Attack</b></td>
        <td>You make an attack with a weapon. If you have Extra Attack, you can then make extra attacks.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Cast a Spell</b></td>
        <td>You cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action. (Note: you can only cast one non-cantrip spell per turn, even if one of the two non-cantrips just requires a bonus action.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Dash</b></td>
        <td>You spend your action dashing. This will let you move double your speed, so if your speed is 30, you can move 60 feet with a dash.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Disengage</b></td>
        <td>You disengage from any melee combat. This will make you immune to opportunity attacks during your turn, the classic "LET'S GFTO!" action.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Dodge</b></td>
        <td>You attempt to dodge incoming attacks. All attackers will have disadvantage against you until the start of your next turn.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Hide</b></td>
        <td>You attempt to hide (the DM decides if this attempt is reasonable in your current surroundings). You make a Stealth skill
       check to determine its effectiveness,  and enemies can use their actions on Perception checks to find you. You will have advantage
        attacking targets who can't see you, and they will have disadvantage attacking you. Once you attack, enemies typically become aware
        and you are no longer hidden to them.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Ready</b></td>
        <td>You ready an action to be taken using your reaciton when certain conditions are met. See <b>Trigger a readied action</b> below.
        You can choose not to take the readied action when its conditions are met, but if the action is a spell that requires a spell slot, the slot is consumed.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Use an Item</b></td>
        <td>You use an item, such as a <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Potion%20of%20Healing#content">Healing Potion</a> or a <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spell%20Scroll#content">Spell Scroll</a>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Dash</b></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  </p>

  <h2>What can I do when it isn't my turn?</h2>
  <p>
  When it isn't your turn, you can take a reaction. You get one reaction per round (one inbetween each of your turns). Common
  examples are:
  <h3>Opportunity attack</h3>
  When an enemy moves away from your reach <i>and you're wielding a melee weapon,</i> you
  can use your reation to perform an opportunity attack. This is a normal melee attack (just one, even if you have Extra Attack).
  <h3>Cast a reaction spell</h3>
  If a spell's description defines it as a reaction, such as <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shield">Shield</a> and
  <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/counterspell">Counterspell</a>, you can cast it using your reaction as described
  in the spell.
  <h3>Trigger a readied action</h3>
  Sometimes, you will want to spend the action on your turn (or before combat starts) readying an action. This would sound like
  "I draw my bow and get ready to fire at the first goblin I see" or "I ready a Magic Missile for the first person who attacks."
  When the condition you described is met, you can (but don't have to) use your reaction to perform the action.
