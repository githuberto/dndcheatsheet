    <a name="Ability Modifier"><h2>Ability Modifier</h2></a>

    <b>Ability modifiers</b> are values determined by your character's ability scores. You add these
    values to dice rolls (e.g., you add your Str modifier to attack rolls with a longsword,

    Roll20, your relevant ability modifier will be added automatically.

    <a name="Advantage"><h2>Advantage</h2></a>
    <p>
    When you make a roll with <b>advantage</b> (e.g., when attacking a prone target in melee), you
    roll your <span>d20</span> twice and take the higher roll. The DM may give you advantage
    based on the situation your character is in, and a number of spells and other
    effects can give you advantage, such as <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Faerie%20Fire#content">Faerie Fire</a>
    and <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Guiding%20Bolt#content">Guiding Bolt</a>.

    <b>Armor class</b>, also know as <b>AC</b>, is a number representing how hard
    a target is to hit. When attacking a target, the attacker's attack roll must

    you would have to get a 15 or higher on your attack roll.

    <p>
    When you make a roll with <b>disadvantage</b> (e.g., when attacking a prone target from range), you
    roll your <span>d20</span> twice and take the lower roll. A number of spells and other
    effects can give you or your attacker disadvantage, such as <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Vicious%20Mockery#content">Viscious Mockery</a>
