  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
  This site is a cheat-sheet for playing Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. The
  goal is to help you quickly learn the rules and look things up on the fly so
  you can focus on the fun part: playing the game.
  </p>
  <p>
  This page covers some of the basics that you'll need to understand throughout
  the document. From here, proceed to the section you're curious about, and be
  sure to check out the <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a> for any unfamiliar
  terms.
  </p>
  <h2>Dice</h2>
  <p>
  DND uses dice rolls as a source of randomness in order to keep the game
  exciting. If you always knew whether or not you were going to suceed on
  a skill check or an attack, the game would grow stale quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
  There are a lot of different dice with different numbers of sides (aka faces)
  in DND, so we need a way to talk about them. A die is identified by saying (or
  typing) a "d" followed by the number of faces it has. We call the classic
  six sided die a <span>d6</span>, and the most common die in DND is the <span>d20</span>.
  </p>
  <h3>Rolling in Roll20</h3>
  <p>
  To roll dice in Roll20, you type a roll command into the chat box:
  <table class="hidden_table">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><span>/roll</span> (or <span>/r</span>)</td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>Rolls dice publicly, most of the time you will use this version.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span><span>/gmroll</span> (or <span>/gr</span>)</td>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>Rolls dice privately, only you and the GM can see the result.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  </p>
  <p>
  When you roll dice, you use the syntax <span>(number)d(faces)+(modifier)</span>. Everything
  except for the <span>d(faces)</span> is optional.
  This is best explained through examples:
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Roll20 Command</th>
        <th>Explanation</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><span>/r d20</span></th>
        <td>Rolls a single <span>d20</span>.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span>/r d20+5</span></th>
        <td>Rolls a single <span>d20</span> and adds 5 to the result.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span>/r 3d8</span></th>
        <td>Rolls three <span>d6</span>s.
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span>/r 4d4+4</span></th>
        <td>Rolls four <span>d4</span>s and adds 4 to the result.
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
